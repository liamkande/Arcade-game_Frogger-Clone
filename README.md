# Arcade-game (A Frogger Clone)

This is the **3rd** project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program. It provides art assets and a simple game engine that must be used to build a frogger clone. I am required to implement only the basic game, but am encouraged to implement additional features of my choosing.

## The Game

The game is a Frogger-clone, where the player starts at the bottom of the board. The user has to move the player to the top of the board, over the road into the water, while avoiding enemies crossing the road. When the player succeeds, or when the player has been hit by one of the enemies, the game will be reset to the initial state.

You can try the game by openning the **index.html file.**

## How to Play

1. Use the **arrow keys,** the **WASD keys,** or **touches** to move.
2. Avoid the enemies to achieve the river
3. Reach the water by pressing the directional keys to avoid the bugs. Once you get to the water you'll be awarded 200 points. Watch out! If you get hit by a bug you will lose a heart! If you lose all 3 hearts the game will end and your highest level will be displayed you will also have the option to restart the game again.

PS: Collect as many diamonds as you can, they'll increase your score by 50 points!

GOOD LUCK! and Have fun!
